# outerbase

The `outebase` package creates high-dimensional approximations using the
outer product basis function structure. It can be used to construct
predictors for high-dimensional inputs that

-   is stable and consistent

-   remains accurate under massive data

-   leverages large parallel computing resources

-   accommodates flexible data generation

<div class=".outerbase-devel">

``` r
# Install development version from GitHub
#devtools::install_github("mattplumlee/outerbase")
```

</div>

The predictors can be rendered to flexible accuracy depending on
available resources.
