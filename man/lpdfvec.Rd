\preformatted{
logpdf = new(lpdfvec, loglik, logpr)
}
This is a class that contains two \code{\link{lpdf}} object and can be 
manipulated as a single object.  It presumes both are based on the same
\code{\link{outermod}} object, thus they share hyperparameters.  However
the model parameters are concatenated.  Currently also includes variations
on marginal adjustments.  

Currently it is designed only for a pair, but the ordering is arbitrary.
