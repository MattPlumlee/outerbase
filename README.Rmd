# outerbase

outerbase is an `R` package providing regression approaches designed for 
creating emulators for high-accuracy simulations. The package creates 
high-dimensional approximations (near-interpolators) using a unique outer 
product basis function structure. The advantages over other similar approaches 
are efficiency and robustness. It can be used to construct predictors that

- are stable and consistent,

- remain accurate under massive data,

- leverage large parallel computing resources, and

- accommodate flexible data generation.


The software is open source, which can be found on 
[github](https://github.com/MattPlumlee/outerbase/), and it is licensed under 
the MIT license.  For details on installation and references to papers, 
see the [webpage docs](https://mattplumlee.github.io/outerbase/).


A `CRAN` package is on the way, but `Github` will be a reliable way to check 
in on the project:

::: .outerbase-devel

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mattplumlee/outerbase")
```

The project was originated and is actively maintained by Matthew Plumlee (
