# outerbase

The `outerbase` package creates high-dimensional approximations (near-interpolaters) using the outer product basis function structure.  It can be used to construct predictors for high-dimensional inputs that

- is stable and consistent,

- remains accurate under massive data,

- leverages large parallel computing resources, and

- accommodates flexible data generation.

A `CRAN` package is on the way, but `Github` will be a reliable way to check in on the project:

::: .outerbase-devel

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("mattplumlee/outerbase")
```

:::



The predictors can be rendered to flexible accuracy depending on available resources.
